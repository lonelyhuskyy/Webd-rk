        <p class="color1">&quot;Of late people have been killing animals for the sake of
            social media. Several incidents have been reported int he past few months.
            Instead of helping them, people have been recklessly hitting them for immoral
            logic. There are who care for them like their own child. But subsection of society dislikng them
            outnumbers them by millions.&quot;
        </p>
        <h3 id="color2">So what we can do ?</h3>
        <p class="color1">
            We can help them by reporting these cases in police stations and help NGO's and other rescue
            organisations to feed them and provide shelter to them. Together&nbsp;we&nbsp;have&nbsp;to&nbsp;rescue&nbsp;them.
